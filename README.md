Title: Market Analysis for Microsoft's New Movie 
Studio: Identifying Profitable Film Genres 
at the Box Office 

Description:

This project aims at analyzing the data available in the zipped data folder in order to identify profitable film genres 
at the Box Office in order to guide their new venture into the movie market.
The three major analysis steps used were:
1)To compare the number of movies produced per genre.
2)To compare gross earnings per movie genre.
3)Getting the average gross earnings per movie genre

Conclusion:

1)Adventure, Sci-fi, and Animation had the highest averages in terms of gross earnings 
while Documentaries had the lowest

2)Drama had the highest number of movies between 2010 and 2018 while 
musicals had the lowest number of movies among the genres

Recommendations:

1)The studio should produce Sci-fi, Animation, Adventure, Fantasy, or Action since they average over 250 
million dollars a year.

2)The studio should also aim to produce adventure and action since they have been the most consistent in 
terms of total gross earnings.

3)The studio should also venture into sci-fi and animation since they have a lower number of movies 
produced and result in a very high average gross earnings.
